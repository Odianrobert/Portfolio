        <p>Hello! My name is Robert Odian and I am 35 years old.  I graduated from Brunswick High School in 2002 and from Bowling Green State University in 2006.  My wife's name is Fara and I have a 1 year old son named Harrison.  I have never done any type of coding before the start of this class.</p>
        <p>I am into a wide variety of hobbies.  I enjoy traveling and I am on a mission to visit every US National Park.  I love to go fishing and go as often as I can.  I am an avid sports fan and love all the hometown Cleveland teams.  I love to collect football cards and am constantly buying and selling them on EBAY.  I plan on using my coding skills sometime in the future to incorporate one of these hobbies into something new and creative.</p>
